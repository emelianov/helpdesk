(c)2006-2014, Alexander Emelianov (a.m.emelianov@gmail.com)

This software was designed in 2006 by myself and deployed in one of department of OAO Surgutneftegas - leading Russian Oil company.
As far as i know it was in-use till May 2016.

I published this code for historical purpose only.

Help desk used MySQL Database for storage and Active Directory LDAP for authorization.
Some parts of the code accesing 3d-party MS SQL Database structure of that can't be published.
FastTemplate is used for HTML generation.
